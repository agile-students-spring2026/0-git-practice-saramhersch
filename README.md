[Article on how AI is reshaping — not ending — software engineering](https://reprog.wordpress.com/2026/01/13/the-death-of-software-engineering/)

## Reflection

What I found most interesting about this article is how it puts today’s fears about AI into historical context. The author explains that every major shift in programming, from assembly to high-level languages to frameworks, sparked concerns that software engineers would become obsolete. Instead, each change made development more accessible and shifted engineers toward solving higher-level problems.

The article argues that AI is simply the next abstraction layer. Rather than replacing developers, it allows them to focus more on system design, problem understanding, and decision-making while automation handles repetitive tasks. This made me realize that the future of software engineering is less about typing code and more about thinking critically about how systems should work. It also reinforced the importance of learning core concepts instead of relying only on specific tools or languages.
